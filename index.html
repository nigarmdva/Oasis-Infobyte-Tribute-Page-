          legacy of Ada Lovelace, who was a pioneer of computing at a time when
          computers did not yet exist.

            <span>Augusta Ada Byron</span> was born on December 10, 1815 in
            London, United Kingdom; He was able to develop his mathematical
            skills thanks to the support of his mother, who was also his teacher
            and mentor. At a time when women did not have access to higher
            education, Ada Lovelace was recognized and admired by contemporary
            scientists and mathematicians of her time, and she rubbed shoulders
            with characters such as Faraday or Charles Babbage himself, who
            arrived to give her the nickname of "the lovely number". Ada
            Lovelace, is remembered mainly for having written a description of
            the old analytical machine of Charles Babbage, and for having
            developed instructions to make calculations in an initial version of
            the computer.

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>
            His work was forgotten for many years, attributing him exclusively a
            role of transcriber of Babbage's notes. He characterized his
            contribution by calling her his interpreter, although recent
            research shows the originality of his point of view on the
            instructions necessary for the operation of the analytical machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only was Lovelace a pioneer of programming, but she saw beyond
            Babbage's vision for calculation to other potential uses for the
            analytical engine. She saw that the instructions and data need not
            represent numbers and numerical operations, but could also represent
            letters, images or music - a vision of modern computers and software
            over a century before they came into existence.

              Ada Lovelace was the first person to write a program for a
              programmable computer, wrote a "plan" where she describes the
              steps that would allow calculating the values ​​of Bernoulli's
              numbers, her first program, which used two loops, with this she
              demonstrated the ability to bifurcation of the Babbage machine. He
              also described how trigonometric operations that had variables
              could be calculated using the Babbage machine.

              In recognition of his work there is a programming language that
              bears his name, based on Pascal and created in 1979 by the United
              States Department of Defense. The "ADA Programming Language" is
              used mainly in those environments where great safety and
              reliability is indispensable, which is why it is chosen by the
              defense departments, the aeronautical industry and the aerospace
              industry, among others.

          His work has been very studied in recent times and in 2010 he
          published a film about his life, "The lovely number".
